25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~good defending by everton , jagielka & co .
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~liverpool without suarez are just coutinho 
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~everton defending really well
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~why isn't suarez playing ? liverpool want to win ... surely ?
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~8wn just been shopping in liverpool made me rember the good nights we've had there , liverpool reunion needed üç∏üç∑üôã
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~everton relying on our defence atm sort or out ! great defending so far though
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~jagielka putting an absolute shift in . what a player . 
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~having sampled managing everton on fifa 13 ( that's right ! ) , i have massive respect for david moyes . the squad is threadbare , at best !
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~it's ok , she got distracted by liverpool fucking up again ...
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~this game is end to end and that's what i like to see in a derby game .. but my money on everton to score first out the two team's . 
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~1978 morgans changing room outburst when liverpool beat us ... 
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~cool .. rt : ewa cool rt : i'm a liverpool fan already .. u be on my side , just incase .....!! :)

25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~ ill be in liverpool in 4 weeks ;)
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~i'm a liverpool fan but have so much respect for david moyes
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~if everton had good strikers they would finish in the top 4 and make the champions league
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~has sturridge played for everton ? no ? that would explain it then
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~since 1992 : 1 . chelsea - ¬£842m - 3 titles 2 . man city - ¬£704m - 1 title 3 . liverpool - ¬£602m - 0 titles 4 . united - 532m - 13 titles

25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~liverpool always let me down in my bets why do i bet them
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~not great so far from liverpool .

25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~pains me to say but i love everton's back 4 . 
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~gibson replacing rodwell was a very decent bit of business for everton i think
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~he's something ‚Äú : coutinho ... probably the only reason to watch liverpool now . ‚Äù
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~phil jagielka singly handily keeping everton in this game .

25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~outstanding touch from henderson to create a chance for liverpool . seems to be getting better every week .
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~jagielka keeping everton in the game so far
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~even as a liverpool fan , i can't deny that phil jagielka is a top centre half
25:816:Normal-25~~~~~~~~if it wasn't for jagielka , liverpool would be 2-0 up right now ..
