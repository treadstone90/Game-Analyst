barcelona has to win
barcelona will win la liga but , playing like this , they are lucky there aren't another 10 games left . because they would probably lose it .
barcelona trailing 2-1 at camp nou to real betis .... messi is on the bench . that explains it .
rt : barcelona will not win the best la liga in history , real madrid already did . 100 points .
‚Äú : whats wrong with barca ? ‚Äù i'll tell u , tito is wrong . and messi isn't playing . busquets , puyol , mascherano and pedro are injured
whaaa ? rt : last liga home game barcelona won after 1-2 at half-time was 19 years ago 5-2 vs sevilla on 14 may 1994
so without messi , dey cant evn beat a certain real betis at their own backyard and they call themselves best team in da world . 
this was some minutes ago ... it's 1-2 .. barcelona is losing ... üòî
